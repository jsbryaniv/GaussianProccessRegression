# Project Write-up

## Introduction

[Provide a brief introduction to the project.]

## Methodology

[Explain the methodology used in the project.]

## Results

[Present the results obtained from the project.]

## Discussion

[Discuss the implications and significance of the results.]

## Conclusion

[Summarize the key findings and conclusions of the project.]

## Math Equations

To include math equations in your write-up, you can use LaTeX syntax within dollar signs (\$). Here are a few examples:

### Inline Equations

You can include inline equations by enclosing the equation within a pair of single dollar signs (\$). For example, the equation for the area of a circle is given by $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.

### Display Equations

For display equations, you can use double dollar signs (\$\$) to enclose the equation. For example, the equation for the quadratic formula is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

### Numbered Equations

To include numbered equations, you can use the `align` environment. For example:

$$
\begin{align}
E &= mc^2 \\
F &= ma
\end{align}
$$

This will produce a set of aligned equations with numbers.

## References
