## Discussion

We observe the highest accelerations in the NASDAQ's growth rate around the dates of April 17, 2020, May 5, 2021, and July 25, 2022. Typically, such accelerations follow a period of decline, indicating a local trough in stock prices. These dates coincide with significant macroeconomic events, which are outlined below:

### April 17, 2020:
- **Pandemic Response**: The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic led to global economic disruptions. Markets faced volatility amidst the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
- **Monetary Stimulus**: The US Federal Reserve announced a substantial quantitative easing program to inject liquidity into the economy, aiming to mitigate financial stress.
- **Fiscal Stimulus**: The US Congress passed the CARES Act, providing emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses, which likely had a positive effect on market sentiment.

### May 5, 2021:
- **Economic Recovery**: With the progress of vaccination campaigns and the lifting of restrictions, economic activities resumed, potentially bolstering technology sectors.
- **Accommodative Monetary Policy**: The Federal Reserve sustained its low-interest-rate policy and quantitative easing, further supporting the financial markets.
- **Corporate Performance**: Robust earnings reports from key technology firms, which have a substantial influence on the NASDAQ, likely drove the index higher.

### July 25, 2022:
- **Inflation and Interest Rates**: As the Federal Reserve addressed rising inflation through increased interest rates, this led to market adjustments that may have affected growth rates.
- **Tech Sector Resilience**: Notwithstanding macroeconomic headwinds, the persistent strong performance of technology companies could have buoyed the index.
- **Geopolitical Factors**: Events such as the conflict in Ukraine introduced additional variables into market dynamics, the implications of which would require specific analysis to understand their impact on the NASDAQ.


## Conclusion

[Summarize the key findings and conclusions of the project.]

## Math Equations

To include math equations in your write-up, you can use LaTeX syntax within dollar signs (\$). Here are a few examples:

### Inline Equations

You can include inline equations by enclosing the equation within a pair of single dollar signs (\$). For example, the equation for the area of a circle is given by $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.

### Display Equations

For display equations, you can use double dollar signs (\$\$) to enclose the equation. For example, the equation for the quadratic formula is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

### Numbered Equations

To include numbered equations, you can use the `align` environment. For example:

$$
\begin{align}
E &= mc^2 \\
F &= ma
\end{align}
$$

This will produce a set of aligned equations with numbers.
